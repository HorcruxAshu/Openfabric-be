# Local Setup: 

### Requirements:
> My System Specs: WIN 10, RAM 8GB, SSD 1TB.

> All the requirements need to get started with the project are listed down. 

1. Java Version - JDK 11.0
    + Gradle version for the project is `gradle 6.8`. This version of gradle is compatible with the Java 11.0.    
    Get [gradle](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=6.8&format=bin)


2. PostgreSQL Version - Postgres 15.
    + Create user for your local setup and paste its `user` and `password` in .env file. 
    Get [Postgres](https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1258422)

3. Docker Setup - Docker 4.17.1
    + Installing docker with a higher version had me run into an infinite loop of `Starting the Docker Engine` which after a while threw `WSL` related error. The best version that works well with the Docker is 4.17.1.
